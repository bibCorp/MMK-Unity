# Modular Music Kit
## Unity version

**Modular Music Kit** is a Unity plugin created and sold by bibCorp on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/61797).  
It's also available for [Unreal Engine](https://github.com/bibCorp/MMK-Unreal), and both versions are created from the ground up for their respective editor in C++/C#.

It was originally created as a companion tool for the various music packs created and sold by bibCorp, but then evolved into a standalone editor plugin that could be destributed to other developers.

Developers can use this tool to make simple modifications and variations of compatible music.
Music is compatible if it's exported into multiple sound files where one sound files contains only one isolated instrument.
The files can then be imported into Unreal Engine and assigned into a Modular Music Track, where all individual sound files are re-combined into the completed original soundtrack.
Now it's possible to modify the soundtrack by enabling/disabling/adding/removing individual sound channels.
New variations can be created by duplicating existing Modular Music Tracks, and changing the composition of instruments.

### Example:
A large scale soundtrack with strings, horns and battle drums can be turned into an alternate version by disabling all instruments except for the strings.
Without the the power from the drums and horns, the strings are still playing a recognizable melody, but on their own they now sound sad and melancholy.
The scenario in a game could be returning to the location where a large battle previously played out. The player now looks over the battlefield and what remains after the destruction of the two armies.
This helps create musical themes in the game and extends a soundtrack to offer more variation.
